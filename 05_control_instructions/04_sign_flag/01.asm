    mov ax,-5
    test ax,ax ; test performs a bitwise AND on the numbers it's given
    ; A bitwise AND means performing a logical AND on the binary digits of a number so the Nos have to be converted
    ; to binary digits first. Apparently, for high level languages, logical AND is used to check if the two values
    ; it is comparing are nonzero and it returns true if both are nonzero and false if one is a zero. It is the 
    ; same principle as when it is comparing binary numbers but with the logical AND, it doesn't have to convert
    ; the numbers to binary. Eg it can compare 6 and 0 and give you false as the result
